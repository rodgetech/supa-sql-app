# Supa Sql App

Turn your words into sql.

## Overview

Supa sql app is a service to assist people with writing their sql queries. Sometimes you know in your mind what your queries should do but you don't know quite exactly how to write out the query itself. Supa sql app helps by allowing you to describe your tables in plain human langauge and outputs the generated sql query as per your instructions.

While the main purpose of this project is to showcase as part of the Supabase Hackathon, I hope that some people may find it useful while writing basic and complex queries.

## Features

- Login/Logout with your GitHub account
- Translate human language (details about your tables and query instructions) to valid sql queries.
- Manage your generated sql history
